const fruits = ['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple', 'apple'];

// Iterate over fruits below

fruits.forEach(fruitsItem =>
              console.log('I want to eat a ' + fruitsItem));

// I learned how to use the .foreach() method to add an iteration to each item in a list. I also learned a couple ways to write the callback function with arrows in order to execute the .foreach() method
