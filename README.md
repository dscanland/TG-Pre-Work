## When we hit https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions.

https://www.techtonicgroup.com/ is a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) which is connected with an IP address. Once this address is hit your computer looks up the address in the DNS (Domain Name System) to find out where to locate the address.

## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

After your computer locates the IP address in the DNS it contacts the address server and waits for a response to confirm a connection. After a connection is made your computer sends your request to the address server, and then servers from the IP address will send back the requested information (the webpage). The https portion of the address lets your computer know how its supposed to be read by our computer. Https says the location of the site is a HTML document/webpage. 

## What code is rendered in the browser?

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

## What is the client-side code’s main function?

The main function of the client-side code is to interpret the data sent back from the server in order to produce legible webpages.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

There are many many different assets that can be included as client-side assets, such as fonts, texts, links, images, pdfs, login info, videos, coding languages etc.
